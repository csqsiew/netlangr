Description: This package generates a language network from a list of words.
    A single layered network is generated from orthography or phonological transcriptions. 
    A multi-layered network is generated using both the orthography and phonology of words.
    Network measures can be computed for each word (degree, clustering coefficient, closeness centrality, network component).
